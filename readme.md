# Structure

 1. Fetch the data:

    1.1. filter the data to separate the discussed and the undiscussed topic.
    1.2. Create an html for each of them.
2. Listen to the add button so when the user type something in the input, it will appear in the undiscussed topic(nextTopic).

## Challenge
 - I was struggling to filter the discussedOn.
 - When I add new topic it does not appear to the list.

## Improvemenet

I am really slow so I could not finish everything on time.

## NB: 
It is a bit difficult so that we have to look for different solutions to solve the problem.
